# Race Day

  ## Description
  In this practice project repository, I followed a prompt:

  This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

  Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.
  
  Race number:
  Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
  All others receive a number below 1000.
  
  Start time:
  Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
  Early adults run at 9:30 am.
  Late adults run at 11:00 am.
  Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
